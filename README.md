## Installation

Flarum use Composer to manage its dependencies and extensions. The French language pack is available [on Packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/naga0ka/flarum-ext-japanese) and can be managed that way. Make sure that [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) is installed on your machine, then run the following command in the location where Flarum is installed:

```shell
composer require naga0ka/flarum-ext-japanese-beta6
```

The same command can be used to update independently the French language pack, without updating anything else. Note that because the French language pack will be added as a Flarum's dependency, it will also be automatically updated when updating Flarum and its dependencies via Composer.

## Translating Flarum

Because Flarum is at an early development stage, instructions to translate it are currently unavailable. Please check [our documentation](http://flarum.org/docs/translate/) when it will be written.
