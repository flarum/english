# Slovak Language for Flarum

This is my first attempt on Flarum extension.
It should be compatible with beta.9, but it was not tested yet.

_Time to test it then..._

Test it out by Composer - `composer require customworld/flarum-lang-slovak`

**Note:** This is a fork of Flarum's English language, so title and version history may misbehave.
